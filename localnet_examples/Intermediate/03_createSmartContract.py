This script demonstrates how to create and deploy a basic Algorand Smart Contract (ASC1) using Algokit Utils.

This is where you would include any setup code needed, such as:

- Import the necessary libraries and modules:
  from algokit_utils.beta.algorand_client import *
  from algokit_utils.application import ApplicationClient, ApprovalProgram, ClearStateProgram
- Ensure the deployer account is funded and available

You can find all the foundational code in the 'Beginner' folder.
'''

# Initialize the Algorand Client
algorand = AlgorandClient.default_local_net()

# Create a simple approval program (logic)
approval_program = ApprovalProgram("approval teal code here")  # Replace with actual TEAL code

# Create a simple clear state program (logic)
clear_program = ClearStateProgram("clear state teal code here")  # Replace with actual TEAL code

# Deploy the smart contract
app_client = ApplicationClient(algorand)
app_client.create_app(approval_program, clear_program, deployer_address=deployer.address)

'''
About Creating a Simple Smart Contract:
- Smart contracts in Algorand can be written in Python or Typescript which gets compiled down to TEAL (Transaction Execution Approval Language) by the Puya Compiler.
- Get started writing Smart Contract with Algokit, algorand.co/algokit

Why Create a Simple Smart Contract?
- Smart contracts allow you to automate on-chain agreements and decentralized applications (dApps).
- They are essential for creating trustless environments where predefined rules are enforced without intermediaries.

Remember:
- Ensure your smart contract code is well-structured and tested before deployment.
