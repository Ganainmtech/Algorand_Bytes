'''
This script retrieves and displays the local state of a specific application associated with an Algorand account.


Before running this script, make sure to:

- Import the necessary libraries and modules:
  from algokit_utils.beta.algorand_client import *
- Generate Algorand Accounts
- Ensure the account has opted into the application
- Deploy or have access to the deployed smart contract

You can find all the foundational code in the 'Beginner' folder.
'''

# Initialize the Algorand Client
algorand = AlgorandClient.default_local_net()

# Retrieve account information
account_info = algorand.account.get_information(account)

# Extract the local state for a specific application
local_state = next(
    app['local-state'] 
    for app in account_info['apps-local-state'] 
    if app['id'] == app_id  # Replace with the actual application ID
)

# Print the local state to the console
print(local_state)

About Reading Local State:
- The local state in Algorand refers to the state maintained by an account in relation to a specific smart contract (application).
- This script retrieves the local state for a specific application associated with an account.

Why Read Local State?
- Reading the local state is crucial when you need to verify the current state or data associated with a user's interaction with a smart contract. 
- For example, you might want to:
  - Check a user's balance or participation status in a decentralized application (dApp).
  - Verify if certain conditions have been met before allowing further transactions or interactions.
  - Monitor user-specific data, such as scores, levels, or other custom parameters defined in the smart contract.

Remember:
- Ensure that the account has opted into the application and that the `app_id` is correct.
- The local state can contain key-value pairs representing data specific to the account's interaction with the application.
