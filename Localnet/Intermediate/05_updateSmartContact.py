'''
This script updates an existing Algorand smart contract with new approval and clear programs while preserving the application ID.

This is where you would include any setup code needed, such as:

- Import the necessary libraries and modules:
  from algokit_utils.beta.algorand_client import *
- Have access to the original smart contract details (app_id, programs)
- Ensure the deployer account has sufficient balance to cover transaction fees

You can find all the foundational code in the 'Beginner' folder.
'''

# Initialize the Algorand Client
algorand = AlgorandClient.default_local_net()

# Specify the Application ID to update
app_id = 123456  # Replace with the actual application ID of the deployed smart contract

# Define the new approval and clear state programs (as bytecode)
approval_program = b"new approval program bytecode"  # Replace with actual bytecode
clear_program = b"new clear program bytecode"        # Replace with actual bytecode

# Update the smart contract
algorand.send.application_update(
    ApplicationUpdateParams(
        sender=deployer.address,           # The address of the account deploying the update
        app_id=app_id,                     # The ID of the application to update
        approval_program=approval_program, # New approval program bytecode
        clear_program=clear_program        # New clear program bytecode
    )
)

About Updating Smart Contracts:
- The approval program defines the main logic of the smart contract, while the clear program defines the logic for clearing state (often used when an account opts out).

Why Update a Smart Contract?
- Updating a smart contract allows you to fix bugs, add new features, or modify existing functionality without changing the App ID.
- By keeping the App ID the same, you ensure that the application continues to function as expected, with all user data and interactions preserved.

Remember:
- Only the account with the appropriate permissions (typically the creator or manager) can update the smart contract.
- Ensure that the new programs are thoroughly tested before deployment to avoid introducing new issues.
